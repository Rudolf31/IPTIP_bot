## Prerequisites

In order to function properly, the application will need:
- a Telegram bot token (available from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather));
- an internet connection with or without public IP (Telegram bots do not rely on incoming connections unless webhooks are used to receive updates);
- a containerization system (e.g. Docker or Podman). We also recommend an orchestrator (e.g. Docker Compose);
